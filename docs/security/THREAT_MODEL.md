## Threat Analysis

### 1. Input Validation Threats

**Threat**: Malicious input via protein sequences, PDB files, or configuration
**Impact**: Code injection, resource exhaustion, data corruption
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive input validation
- Sanitization of all user inputs
- File format validation for PDB/molecular files
- Size limits on uploads and inputs

### 2. Model Security Threats

**Threat**: Malicious model weights or poisoned models
**Impact**: Compromised predictions, backdoor attacks
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Model weight checksums and signatures
- Secure model distribution channels
- Model validation and testing
- Isolation of model execution

### 3. Dependency Supply Chain Threats

**Threat**: Compromised dependencies or malicious packages
**Impact**: Full system compromise
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Dependency scanning and vulnerability management
- Package pinning and lock files
- Regular dependency updates
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation

### 4. Data Exfiltration Threats

**Threat**: Unauthorized access to protein designs or research data
**Impact**: Intellectual property theft
**Likelihood**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Access controls and authentication
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging of data access
- Network segmentation

### 5. Resource Exhaustion Threats

**Threat**: DoS attacks via computationally expensive operations
**Impact**: Service unavailability, resource waste
**Likelihood**: High
**Mitigation**:
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Resource quotas and limits
- Request validation and filtering
- Monitoring and alerting

### 6. Container Security Threats

**Threat**: Container escape or privilege escalation
**Impact**: Host system compromise
**Likelihood**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Non-root container execution
- Minimal container images
- Container security scanning
- Runtime security monitoring

### 7. Web Interface Threats

**Threat**: XSS, CSRF, or other web-based attacks
**Impact**: Client-side compromise, session hijacking
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Input sanitization and output encoding
- CSRF tokens and SameSite cookies
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Regular security testing

### 8. Configuration Security Threats

**Threat**: Insecure default configurations or exposed secrets
**Impact**: Unauthorized access, data exposure
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Secure defaults
- Secret management systems
- Configuration validation
- Environment separation
